-- HOW TO REPORT A BUG

If you think you have found a bug in QTidy, we would like to hear about it so that we can fix it. 
The QTidy bug tracking system is open to the public at http://bugs.hjcms.de/.

Before reporting a bug, please use the bug-tracker's search functions
and consult http://bugs.hjcms.de/faq.html to see if the issue is already known.

Always include the following information in your bug report: the name
and version number of your compiler; the name and version number of
your operating system; the version of QTidy you are using, and what
configure options it was compiled with.

If the problem you are reporting is only visible at run-time, try to
create a small test program that shows the problem when run. Often,
such a program can be created with some minor changes to one of the many
example programs in QTidy's examples directory, or to the autotests that
are available in the public source repository on http://gitweb.hjcms.de/.
