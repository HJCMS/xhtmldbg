-- HOW TO REPORT A BUG

If you think you have found a bug in xhtmldbg, we would like to hear about it so that we can fix it. 
The hjcms bug tracking system is open to the public at http://bugs.hjcms.de/.

Before reporting a bug, please use the bug-tracker's search functions
and consult https://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-3.6-branch/page.cgi?id=bug-writing.html
to see if the issue is already known.

Always include the following information in your bug report: the name
and version number of your compiler; the name and version number of
your operating system; the version of xhtmldbg you are using, and what
configure options it was compiled with.

If the problem you are reporting is only visible at run-time, try to
create a small test program that shows the problem when run. Often,
such a program can be created with some minor changes to one of the many
example programs in xhtmldbg's examples directory, or to the autotests that
are available in the public source repository on http://gitweb.hjcms.de/.
